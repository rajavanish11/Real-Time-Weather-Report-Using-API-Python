Real Time Weather Report Using  API (Python)
Since ancient times people desired to know what the weather is tomorrow. They were noticing the hundreds of signs and trying to guess whether it will be snowing or raining tomorrow and still wrong in most cases. 
Moreover, with the help of simple some python libraries and API, we can almost give supernatural power to accurately predict tomorrow wether
The main purpose of this project is to provide a simple application to users to get the current weather conditions of any city they wish to see. 
The feature of this application will be that. This will be a real-time weather forecast that returns the current temperature, current weather description humidity wind speed.
I created this simple weather report application using python. I use some python libraries like request and OS modules. For understanding this application we need to first understand some function and module which is used in this project




API: API is a set of programming codes
that enable data transmission b/w one
application to another. 
Request module: It is used to making
HTTP requests to a specified URL.
JSON-java script object notation, it
like a dictionary. it is a file format 
used to store information in an 
organized and easy to access manner.
OS module: it provides the facility to 
establish the interaction b/w the user 
and operating system.
